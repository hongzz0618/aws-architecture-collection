# 🌩️ AWS Architecture Collection

Welcome! This repository is a curated set of **7+ popular AWS architectures**, each designed to solve a real-world problem using cloud-native services.

> 🛠️ **Note:** These architectures are not final. I'm continuously improving and updating them as I learn and build more—so expect changes and enhancements over time.

Each architecture includes:

- 📐 **Architecture diagram**
- 🧱 **Terraform code** to deploy the infrastructure
- 🧪 **Example app or assets**
- 📘 **Step-by-step deployment guide**
